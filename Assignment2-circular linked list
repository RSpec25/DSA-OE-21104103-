Assignment II- Circular Linked List

Q1. While traversing a single-circular linked list, which condition establishes that the traversing element/variable has reached the first element?

Ans- While traversing a single-circular linked list, when the traversing element reaches the value of the pointer of the head node then it establishes that the traversing element has reached the first element.

Code module to implement this-
bool isFirst(node* head, node* current){
   return (current == head);
}
 
#isFirst is a function that can check whether the current node is the first node or not.

Q2. What are the practical applications of a circular linked list? (Try to find applications in your respective fields)
Ans-  1. Music player: different apps like Spotify, gaana, prime music, etc use a circular linked list for smooth functioning of the playlist.

         2. Browser: different tabs are linked to each other with the help of CLL.
    
         3. Audio/Video streaming: It uses a circular linked list as different bits containing pieces of information of the next and previous node align themself after they reach their address.

         4. Circular Escalator
